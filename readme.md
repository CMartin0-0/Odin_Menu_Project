# OdinProject - Restaurant Menu

This is my solution to the Odin Project's [Restaurant Menu](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page) project. The main goals of the project being practicing DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a restaurant homepage and using JavaScript alone to generate the entire contents of the website.
